# Project-IDE: Real-Time Collaboration in VS Code

## Vision

We aim to build an open, extensible, and privacy-friendly real-time collaboration platform for developers working inside VS Code and beyond. While tools like Visual Studio Live Share exist, they are closed, limited, and centralized. We’re building something better — one that empowers developers, organizations, and open-source communities to collaborate without compromise.

This project started as a **web-based IDE** but has now evolved into a **VS Code extension** to provide a more integrated and developer-friendly experience.
